# CCNA
* This repo is to assist with my studies for the CCNA exam by documenting various topics and compiling commands into a central location for easy reference
* This will be following **Jeremy's IT Lab**'s CCNA course on YouTube
* This is a personal note system for myself and I figured I would make it public in case it halps others too
* Please do NOT submit a pull request unless you catch something is inaccurate or missing context
* I will be breaking this up into days following his course, including screenshots if necessary
