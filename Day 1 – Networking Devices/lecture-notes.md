# Day 1 – Networking Devices
A **Computer network** is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources

Example network devices

    router
    switch
    firewall
    server
    client  

2 pc's connected together make a network by definition

Client examples

    laptop
    desktop
    mac
    apple phone
    etc

* A **client** is a device that acceses a service made available by a **server**

* A **server** is a device that provides functions or services for **clients**

    * Not all servers look like what a traditional server does
    * 2 cell phones could be a client/server if one shares a photo to another one
        * The device requesting the picture is the **client**
        * The device providing the picture is the **server**

A **cloud icon** represents the internet in diagrams

A **switch** is a device that aggregates connections into a single device  
* It provides connectivity between devices in a LAN (Local Area Network)
* They have many network interfaces for end hosts to connect to
* They do not provide connectivity to devices outside the LAN

A **router** is a devce that provides connectivity between different LANs
* They have fewer interfaces than switches
* They are used to send data over the internet

A **firewall** is a device that controls network traffic entering and exiting a network
* They can be placed inside or outside of a network
* They use rules to monitor and control network traffic
* A **next generation firewall** includes more modern and advanced filtering capabilities
* Can be hardware or software based
    * Network firewalls are hardware devices
    * Host-based firewalls are software based
